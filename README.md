This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of Explainable AI (XAI) methods for analyzing and protecting natural resources. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, and explainability workflows to identify key drivers and potential interventions for sustainable resource management.
File: Protection_of_Natural_Resources_XAI.ipynb â€“ Main notebook with all code, analysis, and visualizations.
Features: Data Preprocessing. Machine Learning Modeling. Explainable AI (XAI). Data and Results Visualization.
How to Run: 1) Clone this repository or download the notebook. 2) Install the dependencies in a virtual environment. 3) Launch Jupyter 4) Open Protection_of_Natural_Resources_XAI.ipynb and run the cells sequentially or all at once.
Customization: Replace the dataset paths in the notebook with your own environmental or resource-related data; Modify model parameters or XAI methods to suit your research focus.
